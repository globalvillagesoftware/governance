# Governance

The _Global Village_ is a [GitHub based organization](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/about-organizations) that is dedicated to the development of software tools, large and small, that make software development easier and more pleasant.
The main resource is the wiki where all information about the philosophy and implementation of the _Global Village_ organization is maintained.
Larger projects maintain their own repositories under the umbrella of the _Global Village_ umbrella.
The wiki can be accessed from the tab above.

The repository here contains the tools that support the operation of the _Global Village_ organization.
